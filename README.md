#Android L for M7
Files for the Android L port to the HTC One.
##Build Requirements
The makefiles assume a linux environment where `abootimg` is avaliable. This is avaliable as a package for most distributions:
* Debian/Ubuntu: `# apt-get install abootimg`
* Arch: `$ pacaur -S abootimg-git`

This is a generic branch.  For device specific ports checkout the respective branches, e.g. m7ul for the GSM M7 model and m7wls for the Sprint M7 model
